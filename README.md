# Sorting Algorithms Visualized in Python

This code accompanies a post at [makeartwithpython.com](https://www.makeartwithpython.com/blog/visualizing-sort-algorithms-in-python/). It generates animations of Heap, Bubble, and Quicksort. 

They all end up looking like this:

## Usage

Just run it from the command line:

```bash
$ python sorting.py -sorter heap
```
This will create an image sequence of the heap sort, in the heap folder.

[Read the post](https://www.makeartwithpython.com/blog/visualizing-sort-algorithms-in-python/) to see how to turn the image sequence into a video / gif.
